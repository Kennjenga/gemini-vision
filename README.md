# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Packages Required

- **nodemon**: Automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected during development.
- **@google/generative-ai**: Provides access to Google’s generative AI models for NLP tasks.
- **express**: A minimalist framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.
- **fs**: A Node.js module for handling file operations like reading, writing, and deleting.
- **multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js applications.
- **cors**: Middleware to enable cross-origin requests between different domains.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a .env file for secure configuration management.

## ES6 Setup Issue

### Solution 1: Use `import` Instead of `require`

If your project is using ES6 modules, replace `require` statements with `import`. Here’s how:

```javascript
// Replace this
const express = require("express");

// With this
import express from "express";
```

### Solution 2: Configure ESM in Node.js

If you need to use `require` but still want to use ES6 syntax elsewhere, you can configure Node.js to use `require` by setting `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`:

1. Open your `package.json`.
2. Add the following line:

```json
"type": "module"
```

This allows you to mix ES modules with `require`, but note that some bundlers may still throw warnings.
